Project assignment in INF3121 <br>

This project assignment tasked us with testing and fixing an existing code project, in our case it was a game of Hangman written in Java.
After going through several test cases and looking at the project metrics, we decided the best way to fix the existing code base was to simply rewrite it from scratch.
